		<br>
		<b>
		<ol>
		<li>Have you ever thought about your own business?</li>
		<li>Have you ever got pop in mind about business?</li>
		<li>Have you ever tried to execute those ideas?</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Student age is more creative and always have some innovative ideas. If we execute those ideas in a proper way it would be great success in life. But our education system always teaches us to get good job. It never teaches us about leadership, startup and entrepreneur skill. So at the end of student life, we are always looking for job rather than own business or executing those innovative ideas.</p>

		<br>
		<b>
		<p>Let me ask you a question. How did we make up to college? We studied primary followed by high school and then higher secondary. So now we are able to understand engineering concept. So we can get good job in future (business man can use their technical skill to grow their business). With this type of technical background, what if we start business without knowing any business skill? Obviously certain failure. So whatâ€™s the solution to get success in your start up? We should have experience of startup or small real business along with studies to learn </p>
